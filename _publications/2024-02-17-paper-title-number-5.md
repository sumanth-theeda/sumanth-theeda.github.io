title: "Area-Specific Positioning of Metallic Glass Nanowires on Si Substrate"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-5
excerpt: 'This paper presents a novel technique to fabricate metallic nanowires in selective areas on a Si substrate. Thermoplastic drawing of viscous metallic glass from cavities etched in Si can produce metallic nanowires. The length and diameter of nanowires can be controlled by adjusting the drawing conditions without changing the Si mold. A thin metal shadow mask is stacked above the Si mold during thermoplastic drawing to fabricate the nanowires only in specific locations. The mask restricts the flow of metallic glass to predefined shapes on the mask, resulting in the formation of nanowires in selected areas on Si. An Al foil-based mask made by a benchtop vinyl cutter is used to demonstrate the proof-of-concept. Even a simple Al foil mask enables the positioning of metallic nanowires in selective areas as small as 200 µm on Si. The precision of the vinyl cutter limits the smallest dimensions of the patterned areas.'

This paper presents a novel technique to fabricate metallic nanowires in selective areas on a Si substrate. Thermoplastic drawing of viscous metallic glass from cavities etched in Si can produce metallic nanowires.

A thin metal shadow mask is stacked above the Si mold during thermoplastic drawing to fabricate the nanowires only in specific locations.
