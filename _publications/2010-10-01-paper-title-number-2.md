title: "Review of thermoplastic drawing with bulk metallic glasses"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This study summarizes the recent progress in thermoplastic drawing of bulk metallic glasses. The integration of drawing with templated embossing enables the fabrication of arrays of high-aspect-ratio nanostructures whereas the earlier drawing methodologies are limited to a single fiber. The two-step drawing can produce metallic glass structures such as, vertically aligned nanowires on substrates, nanoscale tensile specimens, hollow microneedles, helical shafts, and micro-yarns, which are challenging to fabricate with other thermoplastic forming operations. These geometries will open new applications for bulk metallic glasses in the areas of sensors, optical absorption, transdermal drug-delivery, and high-throughput characterization of size-effects. In this article, we review the emergence of template-based thermoplastic drawing in bulk metallic glasses. The review focuses on the development of experimental set-up, the quantitative description of drawing process, and the versatility of drawing methodology.'
