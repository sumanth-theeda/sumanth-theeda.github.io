Vertically Downward Flow"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'The present study focuses on the numerical analysis carried in a vertically downward sub-cooled
flow using finite volume based commercial software Fluent by ANSYS Inc. Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute (RPI) boiling model in Fluent is used to predict the void fraction and CHF in a vertically
downward flow. Turbulence effects are modeled by Shear Stress Transport (SST) k-ω and k-ɛ
models. Most of the numerical work carried till date on two-phase flows focused on flow in
vertically upward direction or in horizontal direction. Hence, the numerical models are validated
against the data provided in open literature for vertically upward flows. The same models are
extended for vertically downward sub-cooled flows in present investigation and the results for
upward and downward flows are compared.'
