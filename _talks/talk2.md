# Abstract

Laser powder bed fusion is an emerging additive manufacturing process to fabricate fully dense complex metal parts with high accuracy. Laser process parameters such as, laser power, hatch spacing, scan speed, scan strategy and layer thickness play a major role in defining the quality of the as-built parts. Stainless steel 316L (SS316L) is known for its excellent corrosion resistance, high tensile strength, and high-performance at elevated temperatures. SS316L is used in many applications in the field of automotive, aerospace, medical and heavy equipment industries. In the current study, experiments are designed using Taguchi method to understand the effect of process parameters on the mechanical properties of as-built SS316L parts. Surface roughness of as-built parts is characterized by using digital optical microscopy. The relative density and Vickers microhardness are measured for the as-built parts. Finally, an optimal processing region for laser process parameters is identified.
