Two-phase flows are encountered in various applications in power plants, chemical plants and
nuclear industry. The current day industries requirement is to operate these two-phase flow
equipments over a wide range of operating conditions and is subjected to harsh environment driven
by high temperature corrosive gases. This prompts for usage of expensive materials and thermal
coatings to protect from tube burnout and thereby extend the life, without compromising on cost. In
the context of modernization or up-gradation of the existing equipment, the transportation limits put
several constraints on making the heat exchanger fatter or taller, thereby adding to the complexity.
To make these heat exchangers compact without compromising on its efficiency, one should look
for alternative ways. One of the ways of doing it is to increase the number of passes by routing
tubes in such a way that the two-phase mixture travels downwards and upwards in a periodical
manner. This brings in additional risks of premature tube burnout by reaching Critical Heat Flux
limit, two-phase flow instabilities and other potential risks, especially when the flow takes place in
a vertically downward direction. Critical Heat Flux (CHF) or post burnout refers to the sudden
decrease in heat transfer coefficient for a surface on which evaporation or boiling occurs. Exceeding
this heat flux causes the replacement of liquid adjacent to the heat transfer surface with a vapor
blanket. This blanket acts as a barrier to heat flow from the heat dissipating body, resulting in
possible catastrophic failure. Hence accurate estimation of CHF risk is a mandate not only from
performance or life perspective, but also more important from safety perspective. Further,
conducting numerous experiments to understand the flow patterns and the CHF in vertically
downward two-phase flow is time consuming and expensive. All these constraints give an
opportunity to leverage the numerical tools that are relatively less expensive and are quicker to
estimate CHF.

The present study focuses on the numerical analysis carried in a vertically downward subcooled
flow using finite volume based commercial software Fluent by ANSYS Inc. Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute (RPI) boiling model in Fluent is used to predict the void fraction and CHF in a vertically
downward flow. Turbulence effects are modelled by Shear Stress Transport (SST) k-ω and k-ɛ
models. Most of the numerical work carried till date on two-phase flows focused on flow in
vertically upward direction or in horizontal direction. Hence, the numerical models are validated
against the data provided in open literature for vertically upward flows. The same models are
extended for vertically downward subcooled flows in present investigation and the results for
upward and downward flows are compared.
