# About me

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas, specializing in advanced manufacturing techniques for metallic components. My research, conducted in the [Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/kumar-lab/)focuses on bulk metallic glasses and microfabrication, resulting in multiple publications and a provisional patent.

With a strong background in design for manufacturing, cleanroom processing, and data-driven optimization, I bring expertise in tools like SolidWorks, COMSOL, AutoCAD, and statistical analysis software. I have hands-on experience in additive manufacturing, lithography, etching, and microfluidic device fabrication.

I am passionate about interdisciplinary problem-solving at the intersection of nanofabrication, materials design, and process optimization. Actively seeking full-time opportunities starting December 2024, I am excited to contribute to cutting-edge innovations in nanotechnology, manufacturing, and fluid systems.
