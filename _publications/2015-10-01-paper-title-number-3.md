excerpt: 'We report a facile technique to fabricate metallic nanowires on selective areas on silicon. Nanowires are fabricated by thermoplastic drawing of bulk metallic glass from microscale cavities etched in silicon. The metallic nanowires are formed only on selective areas by using aluminum foil masks. The mask restricts the flow of bulk metallic glass to predefined openings during thermoplastic processing and enables the formation of nanowires on selective areas on silicon. We show that nanowires with different aspect-ratios can be formed by tailoring the drawing conditions without changing the silicon. Inexpensive aluminum masks can produce a wide range of nano-patterned areas in the size range of 200 Âµm and larger.'
