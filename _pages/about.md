As a graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on developing and optimizing novel fabrication techniques for metallic components. I work in the Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Lab, where I have published papers on selective area fabrication and area specific positioning of bulk metallic glasses, and I am working on integrating bulk metallic glass nanowires in microfluidic channels. I am also applying machine learning and deep learning algorithms to optimize the process parameters in laser powder bed fusion, a widely used technique in additive manufacturing.

I have a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University at Buffalo, where I was a graduate research assistant at the Nano/Microfluidics Laboratory. There, I worked on image analysis algorithms to identify and localize an emitter in 3D space, and formulated an objective function using various distance metrics to minimize the errors in the algorithm. I also developed a novel fabrication technique to reduce the surface hydrophobicity of PDMS membranes, and created an oil/nanofluid interface in a microfluidic device to study the spreading dynamics and enhance oil recovery.

I have a strong background in product design, problem solving, and design for manufacturing, and have experience of using various CAE, CAD, and programming tools. I am passionate about conducting interdisciplinary research that can advance the fields of nanofabrication, nanomaterials, additive manufacturing, microfluidics, and fluid simulations.

I am actively looking for a full time position starting from June 2024. I am open to discuss any relevant opportunities and I love talking about nano-stuff!
