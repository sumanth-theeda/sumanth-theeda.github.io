# About me

I am a final year Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on developing and optimizing novel fabrication techniques for metallic components. I work in the [Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/kumar-lab/), where I have published papers on selective area fabrication and area specific positioning of bulk metallic glasses. For my dissertation, I am working on integrating bulk metallic glass nanowires in microfluidic channels and study their performance in particle trapping. I am also applying machine learning and deep learning algorithms to optimize the process parameters in laser powder bed fusion, a widely used technique in additive manufacturing.

I completed my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University at Buffalo, where I was a graduate research assistant at the Nano/Microfluidics Laboratory. There, I worked on various projects involving image analysis algorithms and developed a novel fabrication technique to reduce the surface hydrophobicity of PDMS membranes.

I have a strong background in product design, problem solving, and design for manufacturing, and have experience of using various CAE, CAD, and programming tools. I am passionate about conducting interdisciplinary research that can advance the fields of nanofabrication, nanomaterials, additive manufacturing, microfluidics, and fluid simulations.

I am actively looking for a full time position starting from June 2024. I am open to discuss any relevant opportunities and I love talking about nano-stuff!
